In this project, I have used Amazon fine food review. The dataset has 10 columns and more than half million rows. The dataset has three main columns 
which are summary, text and score. Mainly the socre is notjing but ratings within range 1-5. Since the dataset is huge and my local machine is not good enough to handle whole dataset so i decided to work with 100000 records.
I have taken 50000 from negative ratings and 50000 from positive ratings. At last I have applied some regular classifier to sentiment analysis.
Thank you.
